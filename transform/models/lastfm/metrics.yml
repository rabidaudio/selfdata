    description: >
      6-month average of number of listens by hour of day.
      Recreation of the "Listening Clock" from the Last.FM report.
      Aggregated by user. Hours are in Eastern time (America/New_York).
      In the future, we could store a username-timezone lookup table
      in dbt seeds, and then calculate the distribution in the user's
      timezone.
